# Information - custom_components

This organization (shared space) was a result of a short discussion over on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/c5DvZ4e).

A similar organization (shared space) was also made for [custom_cards](https://github.com/custom-cards).

This shared space is **not** supposed to be a replacement of any kind to the Official sites/documentation for Home Assistant.

 - [Home Assistant GitHub](https://github.com/home-assistant)
 - [Home Assistant website](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
 - [Home Assistant developer documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/)

This shared space is a place where all users that deveolp custom_components are invited to share their codes for discoverability.
This space has some benefits.
 - Users that are looking for custom_components will have fever places to look.
 - There is less chance that multiple developers are working on the same thing.

#### Rules
Like all other places there are need for some rules.
Your repo should have a name like this `component.platform` so for a sensor platform named abc the repo should be named `sensor.abc`, if abc is a component and not a platform give it the name `abc`.

In the repo there should be atleast 2 files.
the component/platform (.py) file, and a README.md file.
The README file should contain instructions on how to "install" it (which folder to put the file in), and a configuration example.

#### Want access to push your amazing stuff to this space?
Contact one of the users with an owner role.
